# SumUp Golang Lessons

[SumUp](https://sumup.com/) hosts an educational course to learn Go programming language.

Why Learn Go?

Go (or Golang) is an open source programming language designed to build fast, reliable, and efficient software at scale.

Golang has many [advantages](https://meritocracy.is/blog/2021/04/06/golang-why-you-should-learn-go-in-2021/), both well-known and not so well known.

Here is the list of some of its advantages:

• Simplicity of code

• A large number of libraries

• Flexibility

• Straightforward build process

Actually, simplicity was the main goal of creating the language, and it was achieved. Go has a fairly simple syntax (with some assumptions) that you can develop applications faster than in other languages.

As Go’s popularity and adoption continue to increase, we’ll see even greater usage and more creative implementations of the language!

SumUp provides a free learning course to learn Go programming language.

## Learning Tracks

We have two learning tracks - Beginners and Advanced.

The Beginners track is intended for people without computer science background. We start slowly and gentle with the basics of programming. If you have no programming experience, this is a right track for you.

The Advanced track is intended for people who want to switch from another programming language to Go or want to dive deeper into Golang.

Sessions are conducted online every other **Wednesday** from **4:00pm to 5:00pm** online:

- Beginners Track: [Zoom link](https://sumup.zoom.us/j/98019958476)
- Advanced Track: [Zoom link](https://sumup.zoom.us/j/93881003779)

## Enrollment

Next sessions start on September 7th.

## Learning Materials

Lessons for the Advanced track can be found [here](https://github.com/sumup-go/lessons/tree/main/advanced).

Lessons for the Beginners track can be found [here](https://github.com/sumup-go/lessons/tree/main/advanced).

## Setup

We need to install the following on your laptop:
* Go Compiler
* IDE. You can use VSCode or Goland of your choice. Note, Golan**g** is a programming language and Golan**d** is IDE (Integrated Development Environment). VSCode is another IDE. You can use either of them.

Installation.

1. Download and install IDE: [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/download/#section=mac) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Download and install the [Go Compiler](https://go.dev/doc/install)
